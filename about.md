<h1>I'm Always Up to Learn New Things.</h1>

<p>I'm an aspiring software developer and a Machine Learning Enthusiast. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Jaypee Institute Of Information Technology. Being a developer you constantly have to learn new skills and grasp knowledge of everything, and that is what i enjoy.</p>

<p>My mom and dad, despite being physically challenged, worked hard to send me and my brother to the most expensive private school in the town. I take pride in that. I am grateful to have been blessed with such great parents. Although i have completed my High School and Intermediate from Kendriya Vidyalaya.</p>

<p>I was born in the city of Aligarh, India - "The city of Locks". I learnt 4 languages (English, Hindi, Urdu & Sanskrit) at my school, though I'm not fluent with Urdu and Sanskrit.I want to travel the world and capture it as I see it from my lens. I am quite active on Instagram.</p>

<p>I have recently started working on my fitness, you know - "Fit Mind Lies in Fit Body". Apart from that I'm a Food Lover too. I enjoy different cuisines. We can discuss places to eat around mid-town, & talk about shows on Netflix.</p>
